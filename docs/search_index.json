Here’s a look at the weights of newborn chicks split by the feed supplement they received: And here’s the code: library(datasets) # data library(ggplot2) # plotting # reorder supplements supps &lt;- c(&quot;horsebean&quot;, &quot;linseed&quot;, &quot;soybean&quot;, &quot;meatmeal&quot;, &quot;sunflower&quot;, &quot;casein&quot;) # boxplot by feed supplement with jitter layer ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = factor(feed, levels = supps), y = weight)) + # plotting geom_boxplot(fill = &quot;#cc9a38&quot;, color = &quot;#473e2c&quot;) + geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, width = 0.1, color = &quot;#926d25&quot;) + # formatting ggtitle(&quot;Casein Makes You Fat?!&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Boxplots of Chick Weights by Feed Supplement&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Feed Supplement&quot;, y = &quot;Chick Weight (g)&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: datasets::chickwts&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;)) + theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, color = &quot;grey35&quot;)) + theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = &quot;grey68&quot;)) For more info on this dataset, type ?datasets::chickwts into the console. 6.3 Simple Examples Okay…much simpler please. Let’s use the airquality dataset from the datasets package: library(datasets) head(airquality, n = 5) ## Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day ## 1 41 190 7.4 67 5 1 ## 2 36 118 8.0 72 5 2 ## 3 12 149 12.6 74 5 3 ## 4 18 313 11.5 62 5 4 ## 5 NA NA 14.3 56 5 5 6.3.1 Boxplot using Base R # plot data boxplot(airquality, col = &#39;lightBlue&#39;, main = &quot;Base R Boxplots of airquality&quot;) Boxplots with Base R are super easy. Like histograms, boxplots only need the data. In this case, we passed a dataframe with six variables, so it made separate boxplots for each variable. You may not want to create boxplots for every variable, in which case you could specify the variables individually or use filter from the dplyr package. 6.3.2 Boxplot using ggplot2 # import ggplot library(ggplot2) # plot data g1 &lt;- ggplot(stack(airquality), aes(x = ind, y = values)) + geom_boxplot(fill = &quot;lightBlue&quot;) + # extra formatting labs(x = &quot;&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;ggplot2 Boxplots of airquality&quot;) g1 ## Warning: Removed 44 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). ggplot2 requires data to be mapped to the x and y aesthetics. Here we use the stack function to combine each column of the airquality dataframe. Reading the documentation for the stack function (?utils::stack), we see the new stacked dataframe has two columns: values and ind, which we use to create the boxplots. Notice: ggplot2 warns us that it is ignoring “non-finite values”, which are the NA’s in the dataset. 6.4 When to use Boxplots should be used to display continuous variables. They are particularly useful for identifying outliers and comparing different groups. Aside: Boxplots may even help you convince someone you are their outlier (If you like it when people over-explain jokes, here is why that comic is funny.). 6.5 Considerations Flipping Orientation: Often you want boxplots to be horizontal. Super easy to do: just tack on coord_flip(): # g1 plot from above (5.3.2) g1 + coord_flip() ## Warning: Removed 44 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot). NOT for categorical data: Boxplots are great, but they do NOT work with categorical data. Make sure your variable is continuous before using boxplots. Here’s an example of what not to do: library(likert) # data library(dplyr) # data manipulation # load/format data data(pisaitems) pisa &lt;- pisaitems[1:100, 2:7] %&gt;% dplyr::mutate_all(as.integer) %&gt;% dplyr::filter(complete.cases(.)) # create theme theme &lt;- theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;)) + theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, color = &quot;grey35&quot;)) + theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = &quot;grey68&quot;)) # create plot plot &lt;- ggplot(stack(pisa), aes(x = ind, y = values)) + geom_boxplot(fill = &quot;#9B3535&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Don&#39;t Plot Boxplots of Categorical Variables Like This&quot;, subtitle = &quot;...seriously don&#39;t. Here, I&#39;ll make it red so it looks scary:&quot;) + labs(x = &quot;Assessment Code&quot;, y = &quot;Values&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: likert::pisaitems&quot;) # bad boxplot plot + theme 6.6 Theory For more info about boxplots and continuous variables, check out Chapter 3 of the textbook. 6.7 External Resources DataCamp: Quick Exercise on Boxplots: a simple example of making boxplots from a dataset.
