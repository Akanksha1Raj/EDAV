Textbooks, cheatsheets, exercises, and other buzzwords full of resources you could go through. There are over 12600 packages on CRAN, the network through which R code and packages are distributed. It can be overwhelming. However, bear in mind that R is being used for a lot of different things, not all of which are relevant to EDAV. To help you navigate the landscape, here we provide a collection of resources that you should be familiar with in the context of this course. This is not to say that any of these resources are prerequisites, but they will come up in the course and we want to give you places to learn about them. Since people come with a variety of backgrounds, we will try to provide the essentials as well as some resources for more advanced users. Do not feel you have to go through all of these resources, but know that they are here if/when you need them. :) As always, if you would like to improve this resource, consider submitting a pull request on the github page. 3.1 Getting Started 3.1.1 Setting up R and RStudio It is super important to get up and running with R and RStudio as soon as you can. This video from DataCamp pretty much covers it. Know that you will be downloading two separate things: R, which is a programming language; and RStudio, which is an IDE (integrated development environment…fancy tool for working with R) that will make working with R a lot more enjoyable. 3.1.2 Use RStudio Like a Pro Great! RStudio is up and running on your computer! Now make sure you get comfy with what it can do. Don’t know your way around the RStudio IDE? I highly recommend this DataCamp course. Sections from Part 1 (Orientation, Programming, and Projects) are the most relevant for this course. They include videos about all the regions in RStudio, how to program efficiently/effectively in the IDE (gotta love those keyboard shortcuts), and the benefits of setting up R projects. A little hazy on that last sentence? The course will help. More Advanced: Another option is this RStudio webinar. Just want a quick reference to brush up with? Take a look at the RStudio Cheatsheets page. 3.1.3 Learning About R R is just like any language, programming or otherwise: you need to use it to get used to it. Just starting out in R? Check out this DataCamp course for a quick introduction. For this course, you can skim/mostly ignore matrices and lists (Parts 3 &amp; 6). More Advanced: Want to curl up with a good book about R? We recommend R for Data Science. It jumps right in, but is quite extensive. Focus less on Part IV (Model). 3.2 Getting More Specific 3.2.1 Installing Packages A lot of the cool stuff comes from installing packages into R. How do you install packages? The main function we use is install.packages(&quot;&quot;), which installs from CRAN, a well-known place where packages are stored. Then, once installed, you can use packages by calling them within library(). Still confused? This DataCamp video should help explain the process. Also be sure to try the accompanying exercise to make sure you have a feel for loading a package. More Advanced: Want more info? Check out this DataCamp article on everything about installing packages in R. As well as covering the basics, this article shows you how to install packages that are not located on CRAN using devtools, as well as ways to monitor the status/health of your installed packages. 3.2.2 Tidyverse Don’t know what the tidyverse is? It’s great and we use it throughout this course. Specifically, ggplot2 and dplyr, two packages within the Tidyverse. What’s ggplot? Check out this DataCamp course. This course is split up into three parts and it is quite long, but it does go over pretty much everything ggplot has to offer. If you are starting out, stick with Part 1. What’s dplyr? Make friends with this DataCamp course. It goes through the main dplyr verbs: select, mutate, filter, arrange, summarise; as well as the lovely pipe operator. More Advanced: Want case studies to go through? Try this one or this one. 3.2.3 Importing Data We often will need to pull data into RStudio to work with it. “Pull data”? I’m already confused. But wait! Here’s a DataCamp course on importing data using dplyr. Note: This course explains how to import every kind of data format under the sun…all you need to be familiar with for this course (mostly) is pulling in CSV files using read_csv. So, if you are overwhelmed, just stick to the read_csv stuff. More Advanced: Importing every data format under the sun you say? I want to know how to do that. Here’s Part 1, as well as Part 2, which focuses on databases and HTTP requests. Go nuts. 3.2.4 R Markdown R Markdown is how you will be submitting assignments for this course. In general, it is a great way to communicate your findings to others. Don’t know about R Markdown? DataCamp course to the rescue! We will be using html formatting so focus on that. There is also an RStudio webinar about it. More Advanced: The R Markdown page from RStudio has lessons with extensive info. Also, more cheatsheets. More Advanced: Want to jump right in? Open a new R Markdown file (File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown…), and set its Default Output Format to HTML. You will get a R Markdown template you can tinker with. Try knitting the document to see what everything does. 3.3 Help Me, R Community! via https://dev.to/rly Relax. There are a bunch of people using the same tools you are. Try to help yourself! This article has a great list of tools to help you learn about anything you may be confused by. Your fellow classmates are a good place to start! Post questions to Piazza to see how they could help. There is a lot of great documentation on R and its functions/packages/etc. Get comfy with R Documentation and it will help you immensely. More Advanced: There is a vibrant RStudio Community page. Also, R likes twitter. Check out #rstats or maybe let Hadley Wickham know about a wonky error message. "]
