["basics.html", "2 R Basics 2.1 Essentials 2.2 Help Me, R Community!", " 2 R Basics So…there is soooo much to the world of R. Textbooks, cheatsheets, exercises, and other buzzwords full of resources you could go through. There are over 12610 packages on CRAN, the network through which R code and packages are distributed. It can be overwhelming. However, bear in mind that R is being used for a lot of different things, not all of which are relevant to EDAV. To help you navigate the landscape, here we provide a collection of resources that you should be familiar with in the context of this course. This is not to say that any of these resources are prerequisites, but they will come up in the course and we want to give you places to learn about them. Since people come with a variety of backgrounds, we will try to provide the essentials as well as some resources for more advanced users. Do not feel you have to go through all of these resources, but know that they are here if/when you need them. :) As always, if you would like to improve this resource, consider submitting a pull request on the github page. 2.1 Essentials 2.1.1 Setting up R and RStudio This video from DataCamp pretty much covers it. Don’t know your way around the RStudio IDE? I highly recommend this DataCamp course. Part 1 is more relevant for this course. Another option is this RStudio webinar. More Advanced: Just want a quick reference to brush up with? Take a look at the RStudio Cheatsheets page. 2.1.2 Learning About R Just starting out in R? Check out this DataCamp course for a quick introduction. For this course, you can skim/mostly ignore matrices and lists (Parts 3 &amp; 6). More Advanced: Want to curl up with a good book about R? We recommend R for Data Science. It jumps right in, but is quite extensive. Focus less on Part IV (Model). 2.1.3 Importing Data DC Importing Data great but overkill mostly use read_csv (different kinds) 2.1.4 Tidyverse Don’t know what the tidyverse is? It’s great and we use it throughout this course. Specifically, ggplot2 and dplyr, two packages within the Tidyverse. What’s ggplot? Check out this DataCamp course. This course is split up into three parts and it is quite long, but it does go over pretty much everything ggplot has to offer. If you are starting out, stick with Part 1. Advanced: Want case studies to go through? Try this one or this one. What’s dplyr? Make friends with this DataCamp course. It goes through the main dplyr verbs: select, mutate, filter, arrange, summarise; as well as the lovely pipe operator. TODO DC Data manip with R dplyr link the main verbs TODO 2.1.5 Markdown Don’t know about R Markdown? DataCamp course to the rescue! We will be using html formatting so focus on that. There is also an RStudio webinar about it. More Advanced: The R Markdown page from RStudio has lessons with extensive info. Also, more cheatsheets. 2.2 Help Me, R Community! There are a bunch of people using the same tools you are. Your fellow classmates are a good place to start! Post questions to Piazza to see how they could help. More Advanced: There is a vibrant RStudio Community page. Also, R likes twitter. Check out #rstats or maybe let Hadley Wickham know about a wonky error message. "]
