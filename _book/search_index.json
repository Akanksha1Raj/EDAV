Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. NOW! Here’s a bar chart showing the survival rates of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic: And here’s the code: library(datasets) # data library(ggplot2) # plotting library(dplyr) # manipulation # Combine Children and Adult stats together ship_grouped &lt;- as.data.frame(Titanic) %&gt;% group_by(Class, Sex, Survived) %&gt;% summarise(Total = sum(Freq)) ggplot(ship_grouped, aes(x = Survived, y = Total, fill = Sex)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;, stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = Total), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.4, color = &quot;grey68&quot;) + facet_wrap(~Class) + # formatting ylim(0, 750) + ggtitle(&quot;Don&#39;t Be A Crew Member On The Titanic&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Survival Rates of Titanic Passengers by Class and Gender&quot;) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;#b2df8a&quot;, &quot;#a6cee3&quot;)) + labs(y = &quot;Passenger Count&quot;, caption = &quot;Source: titanic::titanic_train&quot;) + theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;)) + theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, color = &quot;grey35&quot;)) + theme(plot.caption = element_text(color = &quot;grey68&quot;)) For more info on this dataset, type ?datasets::Titanic into the console. 5.3 Simple examples 5.3.1 Bar graph using base R Base R scatterplots are easy to make. All you need are the two variables you want to plot. Although scatterplots can be made with categorical data, the variables you are plotting will usually be continuous. 5.3.2 Bar graph using ggplot2 library(ggplot2) # plotting 5.4 When to use 5.5 Considerations 5.5.1 Example 5.6 Modifications 5.7 Theory 5.8 External resources "]
